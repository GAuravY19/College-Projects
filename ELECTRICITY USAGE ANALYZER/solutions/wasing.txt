Ways to reduce energy usage by Washing Machines :-

1. Use cold water for daily wash. Washing machines use about 60% of their power to heat water, so using cold water can save a lot of energy.

2. Reduce the number of washing cycles. It is best to wait until you have enough clothes to fully load your washing machine, and use the shortest cycle (Eco mode or fast mode) that can clean your clothes effectively.

3. Switch off the power at the wall. Washing machines also consume electricity in stand by mode, so do not leave your washing machine plugged in when not in use.

4. Choose a washing machine with a lower wattage and a higher energy rating. The power consumption of a washing machine depends on its wattage, which can range from 300 watts to 2000 watts. A lower wattage means less energy consumption. Also, look for a washing machine with a high energy rating (A+++ or above), which means it is more efficient and eco-friendly.

5. Pre-soak stains. If your clothes have stains, pre-soak them in cold water with some detergent before putting them in the washing machine. This can help to remove the stains faster and reduce the need for hot water or longer cycles.

6. Use solar power or controlled load times. If you have solar panels installed in your home, you can run your washing machine during the day when the sun is shining and save on your electricity bills. Alternatively, you can use your washing machine during controlled load times, which are off-peak hours when the electricity demand is low and the rates are cheaper.
