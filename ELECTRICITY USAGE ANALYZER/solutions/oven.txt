Ways to reduce energy usage by ovens :-

1. Use the microwave for small portions of food instead of the oven. Microwaves use half the energy of conventional ovens and can cook food faster, saving up to 80% of the energy.

2. Defrost food before cooking. Frozen food takes longer to cook in the microwave, so defrosting it beforehand can reduce the cooking time and energy use.

3. Use auto settings or timers. Microwaves have different power levels and cooking modes that can adjust to the type and quantity of food you are cooking. Using these features can help you avoid overcooking or running the microwave longer than necessary, which can waste energy.

4. Clean the oven and the microwave regularly. Dirt and grease can affect the performance and efficiency of your appliances, so keeping them clean can help them work better and use less energy.

5. Choose a microwave with a lower wattage and a higher energy rating. The power consumption of a microwave depends on its wattage, which can range from 600 watts to 1500 watts. A lower wattage means less energy consumption. Also, look for a microwave with a high energy rating (A+++ or above), which means it is more efficient and eco-friendly.
