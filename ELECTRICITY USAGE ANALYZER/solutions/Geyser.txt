Ways to reduce energy usage by Geysers :-

1. Keep the geyser temperature around 50°C to 60°C. Higher temperatures can increase the power consumption and the risk of scalding.

2. Change your bathing schedule. Try to use hot water only when you need it, and avoid using it during peak hours (6am to 9am) when the electricity demand is high.

3. Keep the geyser near to the delivering pipe. This can reduce the heat loss through the pipes and save energy.

4. Switch on the geyser when you really need it. You can use a timer or a smart thermostat to control when your geyser turns on and off, instead of leaving it on all the time.

5. Calibrate geyser thermostat at least yearly once. This can ensure that your geyser is working efficiently and accurately.

6. Use low power consuming geyser such as 5-star rating, solar water heating etc. These types of geysers can save up to 50% of energy compared to conventional ones.
