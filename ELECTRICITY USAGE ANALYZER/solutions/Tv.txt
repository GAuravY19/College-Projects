Ways to reduce energy usage by TV's :-

1. Adjust brightness and contrast settings to lower the amount of power your TV uses.

2. Enable power-saving features such as automatic standby or sleep modes, which can turn off your TV when it is not in use.

3. Turn off the screen during music or other audio-only content, which can save up to 50% of energy.

4. Set a sleep timer to avoid leaving your TV on overnight or when you are away.

5. Turn off the TV completely when you are not watching it, instead of leaving it on standby, which can still consume some power.

6. Plug your TV into a power strip and flip the switch on the entire strip when youâ€™re done watching TV to avoid wasting energy.
