Ways to reduce energy usage by Fridge :-

1. Upgrade your fridge to an energy star rated model if possible, especially if it’s more than 15 years old.

2. Set the right temperature for your fridge and freezer, and use the energy saver switch if you have one.

3. Defrost your fridge regularly and avoid frost build-up that can reduce the efficiency and increase the power consumption.

4. Fill your fridge, but do not overcrowd it, and organize your foods properly to allow better air circulation and cooling.

5. Close the refrigerator door properly and avoid opening it too often or for too long, as this can let the cold air escape and increase the energy usage.

6. Unplug your fridge when it’s not in use or when you are away for a long time, or use a smart power strip to reduce standby energy consumption.
