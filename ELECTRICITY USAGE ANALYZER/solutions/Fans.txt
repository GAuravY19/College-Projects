Ways to reduce energy usage by Fans :-

1. Use fans with BLDC (Brushless Direct Current) motors that are more efficient, durable, and silent than conventional motors.

2. Use variable speed drives (VSD) to adjust the fan speed according to the cooling demand and save energy.

3. Use pedestal or table fans instead of ceiling fans whenever possible, as they consume less power and can be moved easily.

4. Use a wall fan instead of a ceiling fan when using AC in a large room, as it can circulate the cool air better and reduce the AC load.

5. Keep your fans clean and well lubricated to avoid dust accumulation and friction that can reduce the performance and increase the power consumption.

6. Turn off your fans when not in use or when you have other sources of cooling such as natural ventilation or AC.
