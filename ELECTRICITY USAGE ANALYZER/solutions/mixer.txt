Ways to reduce to energy usage by mixer :-

1. Choose a mixer grinder with a lower wattage. The power consumption of a mixer grinder depends on its wattage, which can range from 500 watts to 1200 watts. A lower wattage means less energy consumption.

2. Use the mixer grinder only when necessary. Avoid using the mixer grinder for tasks that can be done by hand, such as chopping, peeling or grating. Also, avoid overloading the mixer grinder or running it for longer than needed.

3. Place the mixer grinder on a sound dampening mat. This can reduce the noise and vibration of the mixer grinder, which can also save energy. You can use a sound deadening mat or a silicone craft mat for this purpose.

4. Fit some rubber feet to dampen the noise. Another way to reduce the noise and vibration of the mixer grinder is to fit some rubber feet at the bottom of the appliance. This can also prevent the mixer grinder from sliding or scratching the surface.

5. Move your mixer grinder away from the wall. This can help to improve the air circulation around the mixer grinder, which can prevent overheating and increase its efficiency.

6. Use CFLs or LEDs for artificial lighting. If you use artificial lighting in your kitchen, opt for CFLs or LEDs instead of incandescent lamps, as they consume much less energy and last longer.
