Ways to reduce energy usage by tubelights :-

1. Replace T-12 tubes by T-8 tubes that use less power and have longer life.

2. Replace magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts that have higher efficiency and lower losses.

3. Replace fluorescent tubes with LED lights that are more energy-efficient and environment-friendly.

4. Use lighting controls such as occupancy sensors, timers, or dimmers to turn off or adjust the lights when not needed.

5. Use tubelights only when necessary and turn them off when not in use.

6. Choose tubelights that have lower brightness, warmer color temperature, and higher efficiency.

7. Install tubelights that are shielded, directed, or dimmed to minimize glare and light spillage.

8. Support policies and initiatives that promote dark sky preservation and awareness.
